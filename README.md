Manage Subscriptions and RBAC

# Project:
    title:  'Manage Subscriptions and RBAC'
    module: 'Administer Governance and Compliance'
## Requirements
This lab requires permissions to create Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) users, create custom Azure Role Based Access Control (RBAC) roles, and assign these roles to Azure AD users.

## Scenario
- creating a management group that would include all of Azure subscriptions.
- granting permissions to submit support requests for all subscriptions in the management group to a designated Azure Active Directory user. That user's permissions should be limited only to: 
    - creating support request tickets
    - viewing resource groups
